# music-player
A simple Music Player with JavaScript. All Code is in one HTML file. One of my early projects as I tried to familiarize my self with JavaScript.

In this small app. You can add a track from your computer and play it. Since the app is not connected to any database and the local storage cannot store more than 5 mbs, you are only allowed to upload one track at a time. 

You can play, pause, stop, forward and even add "repeat" dynamically to each individual track. Check out the code.
